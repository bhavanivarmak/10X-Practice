// Record
// Diana plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.

// For example, assume her scores for the season are represented in the array scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]. Scores are in the same order as the games played. She would tabulate her results as follows:

// Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
//  1      12     12       12       0   0
//  2      24     12       24       0   1
//  3      10     10       24       1   1
//  4      24     10       24       1   1
// This means that she broke the record for Max score in game 2 (this is when the highest score increased), and she broke the record for Min score in game 3 (this is when the lowest score decreased).

// Given the scores for a season, find and print the number of times Diana breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

// Input Format
// The first line contains an integer n, the number of games.

// The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of score0, score1, score2, ... ,scoren-1.

// Output Format
// Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective numbers of times the best (highest) score increased and the worst (lowest) score decreased.

// Sample Input
// 9
// 10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
// Sample Output
// 2 4
